=> SO_REUSEADDR is an option that allows you to reuse local addresses.

=> The poll function in C/C++ is used for monitoring multiple file descriptors 
to see if any of them become ready for I/O operations. 

=> struct pollfd objects, where each object represents a file descriptor you want to monitor. 
Each struct pollfd contains the file descriptor (fd) and events to monitor (events).

=> events field to specify the events you're interested in , POLLIN for data to read .

=> revents field to check for specific events , POLLIN for data to read .

=> int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

struct pollfd {
    int fd;         // file descriptor to be monitored
    short events;   // events to monitor (input and output events)
    short revents;  // returned events (output only)
};

returns the number of file descriptors that have events , errors returns -1

=> fcntl: used for file control.

int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... /* arg */);

in network programming, "blocking" refers to a situation where a program halts its execution until a particular operation completes .
when you try to read data from a socket in blocking mode and there's no data available, the program will wait until data arrives before proceeding.

_SETFL: a flag used to indicate that you want to set the file status flags of the specified file descriptor. 

O_NONBLOCK: This is a flag that indicates non-blocking mode. 
When set on a socket, it means that I/O operations on that socket won't block 
the calling process even if there is no data available.
